# Prompter v1.00

**Prompter v1.00** is a lightweight, ready-to-use tool designed to streamline the use of AI prompts. It enables users to quickly insert pre-written prompts, organized in a folder structure, directly into AI chat applications or other text fields with a simple keyboard shortcut.

## How It Works

1. **Create a `Prompts` Folder**:
   - Place the `Prompts` folder in the same directory as the executable.
   - Add `.txt` files containing your prompts to this folder. You can organize them further into subfolders.

2. **Run the Program**:
   - Launch the `Prompter.exe` file.
   - Press `Win+Alt+P` to open a dynamically created menu representing the folder structure.

3. **Select a Prompt**:
   - Navigate through the menu to select a `.txt` file.
   - The content of the file is instantly inserted at the current cursor position.

4. **System Tray Features**:
   - Hover over the tray icon to see the version and author information.
   - Access the "Help" menu for a quick guide.
   - Use the "Buy me a coffee" option to support the project.
